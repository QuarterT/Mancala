suggestions
he BEST advice is to follow the guidelines and principles in the Guide to Building a Browser App. The guide will give you a step-by-step process to get you started and its MVC design pattern will result in clearer, more concise code that can scale functionality more easily.
Theme your game to give it a more personal touch and make it more unique!
Use your Development Tools (Chrome DevTools rock!) to debug and solve issues.
Keep it simple. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) functionality that looks great is better than extra functionality added to a game without polish.

Review and check regularly the Project 1 Code Review to ensure that your project is going to meet the minimum requirements.
Consult documentation and other resources to better understand methods, etc.
Write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code. Check for repeating code and refactor into functions that accept arguments.
