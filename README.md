Mancala game
Game Title: Mancala - The Wife's Favorite game
The name mancala actually references a family of two player turn based strategy games. They are played with small items like seeds, beans or stones as the player pieces. The board has two to four rows of places (usally holes in the game board), and the goal is either capture the most items or prevent the other player from playing. In this version of Mancala, we are going to stick to two rows of holes to move the items in with the goal of capturing more items than our opponent.

I chose to make this game because it is a favorite game of my wife and I.

Lanuages used: HTML, CSS, JS 

Getting started - 
Link to game - [https://quartert.github.io/Mancala/](https://quartert.github.io/Mancala/) 
Pick any pit on your side of the board. Player 1 is the left side, player 2 is the right side. 
Goal is to achieve the most beans by any legal means.
If your last bean of that turn falls in an empty pit, you capture any beans in your opponent's directly neighboring pit. 
if your last bean of that turn lands in your "store", then you get to go again. 
if you run out of beans on your side, the game ends.

suggestions
he BEST advice is to follow the guidelines and principles in the Guide to Building a Browser App. The guide will give you a step-by-step process to get you started and its MVC design pattern will result in clearer, more concise code that can scale functionality more easily.
Theme your game to give it a more personal touch and make it more unique!
Use your Development Tools (Chrome DevTools rock!) to debug and solve issues.
Keep it simple. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) functionality that looks great is better than extra functionality added to a game without polish.

Review and check regularly the Project 1 Code Review to ensure that your project is going to meet the minimum requirements.
Consult documentation and other resources to better understand methods, etc.
Write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code. Check for repeating code and refactor into functions that accept arguments.
